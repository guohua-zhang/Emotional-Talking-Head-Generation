Forced Alignment with Wav2Vec2
==============================

**Author** `Moto Hira <moto@fb.com>`__

This tutorial shows how to align transcript to speech with
``torchaudio``, using CTC segmentation algorithm described in
`CTC-Segmentation of Large Corpora for German End-to-end Speech
Recognition <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09127>`__.

# Overview
# --------
#
# The process of alignment looks like the following.
#
# 1. Estimate the frame-wise label probability from audio waveform
# 2. Generate the trellis matrix which represents the probability of
#    labels aligned at time step.
# 3. Find the most likely path from the trellis matrix.
#
# In this example, we use ``torchaudio``\ â€™s ``Wav2Vec2`` model for
# acoustic feature extraction.

# Generate frame-wise label probability
# -------------------------------------
#
# The first step is to generate the label class porbability of each aduio
# frame. We can use a Wav2Vec2 model that is trained for ASR. Here we use
# :py:func:`torchaudio.pipelines.WAV2VEC2_ASR_BASE_960H`.
#
# ``torchaudio`` provides easy access to pretrained models with associated
# labels.
#
# .. note::
#
#    In the subsequent sections, we will compute the probability in
#    log-domain to avoid numerical instability. For this purpose, we
#    normalize the ``emission`` with :py:func:`torch.log_softmax`.
#

bundle = torchaudio.pipelines.WAV2VEC2_ASR_BASE_960H

model = bundle.get_model().to(device)
labels = bundle.get_labels()

    waveform, _ = torchaudio.load(SPEECH_FILE)
    emissions, _ = model(waveform.to(device))
    emissions = torch.log_softmax(emissions, dim=-1)

emission = emissions[0].cpu().detach()


# Generate alignment probability (trellis)
# ----------------------------------------
#
# From the emission matrix, next we generate the trellis which represents
# the probability of transcript labels occur at each time frame.
#
# Trellis is 2D matrix with time axis and label axis. The label axis
# represents the transcript that we are aligning. In the following, we use
# :math:`t` to denote the index in time axis and :math:`j` to denote the
# index in label axis. :math:`c_j` represents the label at label index
# :math:`j`.
#
# To generate, the probability of time step :math:`t+1`, we look at the
# trellis from time step :math:`t` and emission at time step :math:`t+1`.
# There are two path to reach to time step :math:`t+1` with label
# :math:`c_{j+1}`. The first one is the case where the label was
# :math:`c_{j+1}` at :math:`t` and there was no label change from
# :math:`t` to :math:`t+1`. The other case is where the label was
# :math:`c_j` at :math:`t` and it transitioned to the next label
# :math:`c_{j+1}` at :math:`t+1`.
#
# The follwoing diagram illustrates this transition.
#
# .. image:: https://download.pytorch.org/torchaudio/tutorial-assets/ctc-forward.png
#
# Since we are looking for the most likely transitions, we take the more
# likely path for the value of :math:`k_{(t+1, j+1)}`, that is
#
# :math:`k_{(t+1, j+1)} = max( k_{(t, j)} p(t+1, c_{j+1}), k_{(t, j+1)} p(t+1, repeat) )`
#
# where :math:`k` represents is trellis matrix, and :math:`p(t, c_j)`
# represents the probability of label :math:`c_j` at time step :math:`t`.
# :math:`repeat` represents the blank token from CTC formulation. (For the
# detail of CTC algorithm, please refer to the *Sequence Modeling with CTC*
# [`distill.pub <https://distill.pub/2017/ctc/>`__])

        )
    return trellis


trellis = get_trellis(emission, tokens)


# Find the most likely path (backtracking)
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Once the trellis is generated, we will traverse it following the
# elements with high probability.
#
# We will start from the last label index with the time step of highest
# probability, then, we traverse back in time, picking stay
# (:math:`c_j \rightarrow c_j`) or transition
# (:math:`c_j \rightarrow c_{j+1}`), based on the post-transition
# probability :math:`k_{t, j} p(t+1, c_{j+1})` or
# :math:`k_{t, j+1} p(t+1, repeat)`.
#
# Transition is done once the label reaches the beginning.
#
# The trellis matrix is used for path-finding, but for the final
# probability of each segment, we take the frame-wise probability from
# emission matrix.
